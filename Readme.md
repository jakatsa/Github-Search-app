This is a web application that allows users to search for GitHub users by their username.

Upon entering a search term, the app fetches and displays a list of matching GitHub users along with their profile pictures and profile URLs.

Users can then view repositories associated with each user by clicking the Show repositories button, which retrieves and lists the repositories, including their names and URLs.

The app provides a simple and intuitive interface to explore GitHub profiles and repositories.
